  #make it a git repo
	#make a gemset?

#setup at the beginning of the game

ascii characters title screen?
set up the story for the perfect tic tac toe game--
	in a desolate land, there is no hope
	games are cutthroat, played for survival
(make this backstory an option)

choose a character
PUFFS   (ó)> <(~)  -> o's
NOODLES (fò,,,ó)f <(~) -> x's
type o for puffs and x for noodles
type a character's name to learn his backstory


#initialize cell variables
board = {}
(1..9).times do |c|
	board << c => "#"
end

#randomly decide who's going to go first
#####coin flip flavor text / call heads or tails
## later, have the winner go second

if ai goes first
place in a corner 1379
